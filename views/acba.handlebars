                    When I think back to being a kid in grade school, I have some found
                    memories of the class projects I had to make. I'd get excited
                    getting a book report that involved making a scene from the book in
                    a shoebox or building out a miniature scaled diorama. Heck,
                    sometimes the project was the main reason I finished the book! Any
                    project always required a resourceful imagination. Fast forward to
                    today, ACBA is a great creative outlet for an active imagination.

                    <span>. . .</span> Articulated Comic Book Art is akin to the
                    miniature dioramas found in many museums, and as the name implies,
                    the subject matter is influenced by comic book/superhero themes
